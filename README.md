Most of the general/beginner documentation is located in this file. For additional documentation that is not located in this file, please check the [wiki](https://github.com/Roflicide/MinecraftServerControlScript/wiki). 

## Prerequisites for installation
Ensure that you have done the following before installing MSCS:

### Required Programs
We've made an attempt to utilize only features that are normally installed in
most Linux and UNIX environments in this script. However, there may be a few
requirements that this script has that may not already be in place:
* Java JRE     - The Minecraft server software requires this.
* Perl         - Most, if not all, Unix and Linux like systems have this
                 preinstalled.
* Python       - Required by the Minecraft Overviewer mapping software.
* GNU Wget     - Allows the script to download software updates via the
                 internet.
* rdiff-backup - Allows the script to efficiently run backups.
* Socat        - Allows the script to communicate with the Minecraft server.
* Iptables     - Although not explicitly required, a good firewall should be
                 installed.

If you are running Debian or Ubuntu, you can make sure that these are
installed by running:

        sudo apt-get install default-jre perl python wget rdiff-backup socat iptables
    
### Configuring the firewall / NAT
If you have a firewall installed on your computer, or a router using NAT
installed in your network, you will need to route some ports to your server.
Instructions on how to accomplish this are beyond the scope of this post, but
here are some things you will need to know:
* The default port for the Minecraft server is: `25565`.
* If you wish to run multiple world servers using this script, you will
  want to open a range of ports (for example `25565 - 25575`).

See the [iptables.rules](iptables.rules)
file for a very basic set of rules that you can use with the Iptables firewall.

### Mapping software (optional)
The script uses the [Minecraft Overviewer](http://overviewer.org) mapping
software to generate maps of your worlds.  Minecraft Overviewer is a
command-line tool for rendering high-resolution maps of Minecraft worlds. It
generates a set of static html and image files and uses the Google Maps API to
display a nice interactive map.

If you wish to use the mapping software, you can [download](http://overviewer.org/downloads) premade binaries for
supported systems, or build your own binary from source if needed.

Repositories for automatic installation are also available:
* [Debian/Ubuntu](http://overviewer.org/debian/info)
* [RHEL/CentOS/Fedora](http://overviewer.org/rpms/info)

## Installation
### Downloading the script
The easiest way to download the script is to make a clone of the [git
repository](https://github.com/sandain/MinecraftServerControlScript.git). You must have git installed first. To install git:

        sudo apt-get install git
        
Then:

        git clone https://github.com/sandain/MinecraftServerControlScript.git
        
Note that it will be downloaded into the current directory which you are working in. 

##### Other ways to download

* Get the latest stable [release](https://github.com/sandain/MinecraftServerControlScript/releases).

* Get the development version as a [zip file](https://github.com/sandain/MinecraftServerControlScript/archive/master.zip):

        wget https://github.com/sandain/MinecraftServerControlScript/archive/master.zip



### Configuration

Navigate to the `MinecraftServerControlScript` directory that you just downloaded. Configuration can be done with the included Makefile in Debian and
Ubuntu like environments by running:

        sudo make install
Then, type

        chmod -R u+w /opt/mscs
        chown -R minecraft:minecraft /opt/mscs
This will give the user you created in the config (by default, the user `minecraft`) access to write in the `/opt/mscs` folder. If you configured MSCS manually when you installed the script, then replace `minecraft` with the name of the user you made.

That's it!
If you wish to configure the script manually, please visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/Roflicide/MinecraftServerControlScript/wiki/Manual-Configuration).


## Creating and importing worlds
So you successfully installed the script--great! 

At first, you probably want to [create a new world](#create-new-world) or [import an existing world](#import-existing-world) into the script. 

Then, you should adjust the [settings for the server](#adjusting-server-options) as needed.

### Create new world
The command to create a new world is:

        mscs create [world] [port] <ip>
  
Where `world` is the name of the world you specify, and `port` is the server port (by default, use 25565).
`ip` is optional and will be used if you wish to create multiple worlds across different servers. For now, leave it blank.

Afterwards, simply start the server via `mscs start [world]` where `world` is the name of the world. 

**Finally, accept the EULA**.
As of Minecraft version 1.7.10, Mojang requires that users of their software read and agree to their [EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula).  After the first time you start the server, you need to modify the `eula.txt` file in your world's folder, changing the value of the `eula` variable from `false` to `true`.

The EULA can be found in `/opt/mscs/worlds/myWorld` where `myWorld` is the name given to the world you created.

After accepting the EULA simply start the server using the same command above, and you're all set!

### Import existing world
Suppose you want to import a world folder named `world` into MSCS, and that you want MSCS to recognize this world by the name "vanillaMC".

1. First, if you don't have one already, create a `worlds` folder in `/opt/mscs/`.

2. Create a new folder **within the `/opt/mscs/worlds/` directory that is the name you want MSCS to use for the world**. For this example, I chose "vanillaMC". So, I created a new directory `vanillaMC` within the `/opt/mscs/worlds` directory, so the path would be `/opt/mscs/worlds/vanillaMC`. 

3. Drag the folder of the world you wish to move into the folder you just created. So I would drag the world `world` into the `vanillaMC` folder. The path of `world` (the actual world folder) would now be `/opt/mscs/worlds/vanillaMC/world/`.

The finished file structure should resemble the following, with a world named `world` and a containing folder name "vanillaMC":
````
/opt/mscs/vanillaMC       // The path

world                     // The actual world folder
server.properties         
other world files... (in no particular order)
````

After you've set up the file structure, you now need to create a world entry into MSCS. Do this via:

        mscs create [world] [port] <ip>
  
Where `world` is the **name of the containing folder you created** (so it would be "vanillaMC" from the previous example", and `port` is the server port (by default, use 25565).
`ip` is optional and will be used if you wish to create multiple worlds across different servers. For now, leave it blank.

Afterwards, simply start the server via `mscs start [world]` where `world` is the name of the containing world's folder (again, it would be "vanillaMC" from the last example). Then, accept the EULA, run the start command again, and you're good to go!

As a last note, make sure you check `server-port` and `query.port` in `server.properties` to make sure it does not overlap with other servers created by the MSCS script. Also ensure that `enable-query` is set to `true`.  If you do not have `enable-query` and a `query.port` set, you will not be able to check the status of the world with the script.


## Adjusting server options
There are two ways of adjusting the options through MSCS: changing values in the mscs.properties file and/or editing the msctl file directly.

### The mscs.properties file
The `mscs.properties` file can be found in every world folder (for instance, if you had a world called `myWorld`, the path would be `/opt/mscs/worlds/myWorld/mscs.properties`).

By default, the file only has one line in it: `mscs-enabled=true`. You can add a variety of flags to this file and set them as to a true/false boolean or a variable to your liking.

The following flags are available:
* mscs-enabled - Enable or disable the world server.
* mscs-version-type - Assign the version type (release or snapshot).
* mscs-client-version - Assign the version of the client software.
* mscs-client-jar - Assign the .jar file for the client software.
* mscs-client-url - Assign the download URL for the client software.
* mscs-client-location - Assign the location of the client .jar file.
* mscs-server-version - Assign the version of the server software.
* mscs-server-jar - Assign the .jar file for the server software.
* mscs-server-url - Assign the download URL for the server software.
* mscs-server-args - Assign the arguments to the server.
* mscs-initial-memory - Assign the initial amount of memory for the server.
* mscs-maximum-memory - Assign the maximum amount of memory for the server.
* mscs-server-location - Assign the location of the server .jar file.
* mscs-server-command - Assign the command to run for the server.

The following variables may be used in some of the values of the above keys:
* $JAVA - The Java virtual machine.
* $CURRENT_VERSION - The current Mojang Minecraft release version.
* $CLIENT_VERSION - The version of the client software.
* $SERVER_VERSION - The version of the server software.
* $SERVER_JAR - The .jar file to run for the server.
* $SERVER_ARGS - The arguments to the server.
* $INITIAL_MEMORY - The initial amount of memory for the server.
* $MAXIMUM_MEMORY - The maximum amount of memory for the server.
* $SERVER_LOCATION - The location of the server .jar file.

#### Example key/value pairs

    mscs-enabled=true
    mscs-version-type=release
    mscs-client-version=$CURRENT_VERSION
    mscs-client-jar=$CLIENT_VERSION.jar
    mscs-client-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/$CLIENT_VERSION/$CLIENT_VERSION.jar
    mscs-client-location=/opt/mscs/client/$CLIENT_VERSION
    mscs-server-version=$CURRENT_VERSION
    mscs-server-jar=minecraft_server.$SERVER_VERSION.jar
    mscs-server-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/$SERVER_VERSION/minecraft_server.$SERVER_VERSION.jar
    mscs-server-args=nogui
    mscs-initial-memory=128M
    mscs-maximum-memory=2048M
    mscs-server-location=/opt/mscs/server
    mscs-server-command=$JAVA -Xms$INITIAL_MEMORY -Xmx$MAXIMUM_MEMORY -jar $SERVER_LOCATION/$SERVER_JAR $SERVER_ARGS

Run a Minecraft version 1.6.4 server:

    mscs-client-version=1.6.4
    mscs-server-version=1.6.4

Use Forge to run a 1.8.4 server (requires additional setup):

    mscs-client-version=1.8.4
    mscs-server-version=1.8.4
    mscs-server-jar=forge-1.8-11.14.1.1419-universal.jar
    mscs-server-url=http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.8-11.14.1.1419/forge-1.8-11.14.1.1419-universal.jar

Use the latest BungeeCord successful build (requires additional setup):

    mscs-server-jar=BungeeCord.jar
    mscs-server-url=http://ci.md-5.net/job/BungeeCord/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/bootstrap/target/BungeeCord.jar

##### Additional documentation

More examples and documentation on server customization can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/sandain/MinecraftServerControlScript/wiki/Server-Customization-Examples) page.

### The msctl file
The `msctl` file can be found at `/usr/local/bin`.

The `msctl` file is an additional file for adjusting the properties of your server that are not found in `mscs.properties`. Starting at line 236 and ending at line 385 is where the settings are in this file.

You can set the default settings of **mscs.properties** in this file, as well as some other useful settings:
* Line 305 is the beginning of the **server instance configuration** settings.
* Line 321 is the beginning of the **backup configuration** settings.
* Line 334 is the beginning of the **server log configuration** settings.
* Line 341 is the beginning of the **listing option** settings.
* Line 348 is the beginning of the **mirror image** settings.
* Line 370 is the beginning of the **minecraft overviewer** settings

## Automated backups and restarts

### Scheduling backups
MSCS uses [**cron**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), a scheduler software that can run programs on a set interval of time. Below is an example of one way how you could setup backups via cron to backup a world every 2 hours:

Type the following (in any directory): 

  ````
  export EDITOR=vim
  crontab -e
  ````
  Page down until you get to an empty line. Then paste the following:
  
  ````
  0 */2 * * *  PATH-TO-MSCS backup myWorld
  ````
  * `0 */2 * * *` is the time interval to backup. This particular expression means backup every 2 hours. You can change this to 3, 4, 5 or whatever amount of hours to backup X amount of hours. You can also backup according to days, minutes, seconds, the time of the day, and more. See [the wiki page](https://github.com/sandain/MinecraftServerControlScript/wiki/Backup-and-Restore) for more information.
  * `PATH-TO-MSCS` is the path of where the `mscs` file is (which will be inside the `MinecraftServerControlScript` folder that you downloaded)
  * `myWorld` is the name of the world you wish to backup. Omitting this will backup all worlds.

  For instance, if the `mscs` script is located in `/home/MinecraftServerControlScript/mscs`, and I want to backup the world "vanillaMC" every 2 hours, it would look like this:
  
  ````
  0 */2 * * *  /home/MinecraftServerControlScript/mscs backup vanillaMC
  ````
  
  Finally, press escape, then type
  `:wq`
  to save and quit.
  
  The backups will be saved in `/opt/mscs/backups`. 
  
### Removing backups after X days
You can specify how long to keep backups by changing the `BACKUP_DURATION` in the `/usr/local/bin/msctl` file, on line 331.

### Scheduling restarts
You can schedule restarts for the server following the same method as outlined in [scheduling backups](#scheduling-backups).   Simply change the scheduled command from `backup <myWorld>` to `restart <myWorld>`. `myWorld` is the name of world you wish to restart; omit if you wish to restart all worlds.

## Mapping the world
Minecraft Server Control Script uses [overviewer](http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/) to generate minecraft maps. First, follow the [instructions](http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/installing/) on their site to install overviewer. 

Then, once you have it installed, modify the settings (if necessary) found in `/usr/local/bin/msctl`. The settings can be found starting on line 370 of the document:

 ````
 OVERVIEWER_BIN=$(which overviewer.py)
 OVERVIEWER_URL="http://overviewer.org"
 MAPS_URL="my.minecraftserver.com"
 MAPS_LOCATION="$LOCATION/maps"
 ````

After you've tinkered the settings to your liking, run
`mscs map <world>`
where `world` is the name of the world you would like to get mapped. Omit the world name to map all worlds.
By default maps are saved into `/opt/mscs/maps`.
