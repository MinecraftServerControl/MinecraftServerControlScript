## Overview
**M**inecraft **S**erver **C**ontrol **S**cript (**MSCS**)
is a server-management script for UNIX and Linux powered Minecraft servers.

Features include:

* Run multiple Minecraft worlds.
* Start, stop, and restart single or multiple worlds.
* Create, delete, disable, and enable worlds.
* Includes support for additional server types: [Forge]
(http://www.minecraftforge.net/),
[BungeeCord](http://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/),
[SpigotMC](http://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot/), etc.
* Users automatically notified of important server events.
* LSB and systemd compatible init script,
allows for seamless integration with your server's startup and shutdown
sequences.
* Map worlds using the [Minecraft Overviewer](http://overviewer.org/)
 mapping software.
* Automatically backup worlds, remove backups older than X days,
and restart worlds.
* Update the server and client software automatically.
* Send commands to a world server from the command line.

## Prerequisites for installation
Ensure that you have done the following before installing MSCS:

### Required Programs
We've made an attempt to utilize only features that are normally installed in
most Linux and UNIX environments in this script. However, there may be a few
requirements that this script has that may not already be in place:
* Java JRE     - The Minecraft server software requires this.
* Perl         - Most, if not all, Unix and Linux like systems have this
                 preinstalled.
* libjson-perl - Allows the script to read JSON formatted data.
* Python       - Required by the Minecraft Overviewer mapping software.
* GNU Make     - Allows you to use the Makefile to simplify installation.
* GNU Wget     - Allows the script to download software updates via the
                 internet.
* rdiff-backup - Allows the script to efficiently run backups.
* Socat        - Allows the script to communicate with the Minecraft server.
* Iptables     - Although not explicitly required, a good firewall should be
                 installed.

If you are running Debian or Ubuntu, you can make sure that these are
installed by running:

    sudo apt-get install default-jre perl libjson-perl python make wget rdiff-backup socat iptables

### Configuring the firewall / NAT
If you have a firewall installed on your computer, or a router using NAT
installed in your network, you will need to route some ports to your server.
Instructions on how to accomplish this are beyond the scope of this document,
but here are some things you will need to know:
* The default port for the Minecraft server is: `25565`.
* If you wish to run multiple world servers using this script, you may
  want to open a range of ports (for example `25565 - 25575`).
* If you are using [BungeeCord](http://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/),
  you will most likely need to only open the default port: `25565`.

See the [iptables.rules](iptables.rules) file for a very basic set of rules
that you can use with the Iptables firewall.

### Mapping software (optional)
The script uses the [Minecraft Overviewer](http://overviewer.org) mapping
software to generate maps of your worlds.  Minecraft Overviewer is a
command-line tool for rendering high-resolution maps of Minecraft worlds. It
generates a set of static html and image files and uses the Google Maps API to
display a nice interactive map.

If you wish to use the mapping software, you can [download]
(http://overviewer.org/downloads) premade binaries for
supported systems, or build your own binary from source if needed.

Repositories for automatic installation are also available:
* [Debian/Ubuntu](http://overviewer.org/debian/info)
* [RHEL/CentOS/Fedora](http://overviewer.org/rpms/info)

## Installation
### Downloading the script
The easiest way to download the script is to make a clone of the [git
repository](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs.git).
You must have git installed first. To install git:

    sudo apt-get install git

Then:

    git clone https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs.git

Note that it will be downloaded into the current directory which you are
working in.

##### Other ways to download

* Get the latest stable [release]
(https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/releases).

* Get the development version as a [zip file]
(https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/archive/master.zip):

    wget https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/archive/master.zip

### Configuration

Navigate to the `mscs` directory that you just downloaded.  Configuration can
be done with the included Makefile in Debian and Ubuntu like environments by
running:

    sudo make install

This will give the user you created in the config (by default, the user is
called `minecraft`) access to write in the `/opt/mscs` folder.

If you get a permission error, please see the [troubleshooting]
(#troubleshooting) section.

That's it!
If you wish to configure the script manually, please visit the [wiki page]
(https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/wiki/Manual-Configuration).

### Updating MSCS
Periodically Minecraft Server Control Script is updated to address bug fixes
and add new features. The easiest way to fetch the latest update, assuming you
used [the easiest way to install the script](#downloading-the-script), first
`cd` into the folder where you downloaded MSCS. Then, type:

    git pull

You can alternatively use [one of the other methods](#other-ways-to-download)
to download the latest version.  Just `cd` into the folder containing the MSCS
download to continue.

Once you have the latest version of MSCS downloaded, type:

    sudo make update

## Getting started guide
So you successfully installed the script--great!

At first, you probably want to [create a new world](#creating-a-new-world) or
[import an existing world](#importing-an-existing-world) into the script.

Then, you might want to adjust the
[world properties](#adjusting-world-properties), adjust the
[global server settings](#adjusting-global-server-settings-optional)
(optional), and enable any other
[server software](#enabling-forge-bungeecord-and-other-server-software-optional)
(optional) as needed.

### Creating a new world
The command to create a new world is:

    mscs create [world] [port] <ip>

Where `world` is the name of the world you specify,
and `port` is the server port (by default, use `25565`).
`ip` is optional and will be used if you wish to bind a world server to a
specific network interface (e.g. `127.0.0.1` to enforce local access only).

Afterwards, start the server via `mscs start [world]` where `world` is the
name of the world. The world will then shut down because you have to accept
the EULA.

The EULA can be found in `/opt/mscs/worlds/myWorld` where `myWorld`
is the name given to the world you created.

After accepting the EULA simply start the server using the same command above,
and you're all set!

### Importing an existing world

You just need to create a new directory in the worlds folder for the world you
wish to import. Suppose the world you wish to import is called `alpha`, you
would create a new folder in `/opt/mscs/worlds` with the same name as the
world, then copy the data files over to that new directory.

IMPORTANT: make sure the world that you are importing is not currently
running.

If the directory containing the world `alpha` you wish to import looks like
this:

    $ ls
    alpha
    banned-ips.txt
    banned-players.txt
    crash-reports
    logs
    ops.txt
    server.properties
    white-list.txt

You can just copy your world into the worlds directory:

    mkdir /opt/mscs/worlds/alpha
    cp -R * /opt/mscs/worlds/alpha

After you've copied the world files, you will want to [create a world entry
into MSCS](#creating-a-new-world) using the name of the world and the port
that you wish the world to use:

    mscs create alpha 25565


#### Renaming world folder (optional)
If you would like to rename the `alpha` folder
(the one that is the parent folder of the actual world) to a different name,
follow the steps below.

IMPORTANT: make sure the world that you are importing is not currently
running.

In this example we want to rename the `alpha` folder to `vanillaMC`:

    mkdir /opt/mscs/worlds/vanillaMC
    cp -R * /opt/mscs/worlds/vanillaMC
    mv /opt/mscs/worlds/vanillaMC/alpha /opt/mscs/worlds/vanillaMC/vanillaMC

After you've set up the file structure, [you can now create a world entry
into MSCS](#creating-a-new-world) using the name of the world and the port
that you wish the world to use:

    mscs create vanillaMC 25565

### Adjusting world properties
The `mscs.properties` file can be found in every world folder
(for instance, if you had a world called `myWorld`, the path would be
`/opt/mscs/worlds/myWorld/mscs.properties`).
This file allows you to adjust many different properties for each world
you have.  By default, the file only has one line in it: `mscs-enabled=true`.

The following properties are available:
* mscs-enabled - Enable the world server (true or false).
* mscs-version-type - Assign the version type (release or snapshot).
* mscs-client-version - Assign the version of the client software.
* mscs-client-jar - Assign the .jar file for the client software.
* mscs-client-url - Assign the download URL for the client software.
* mscs-client-location - Assign the location of the client .jar file.
* mscs-server-version - Assign the version of the server software.
* mscs-server-jar - Assign the .jar file for the server software.
* mscs-server-url - Assign the download URL for the server software.
* mscs-server-args - Assign the arguments to the server.
* mscs-initial-memory - Assign the initial amount of memory for the server.
* mscs-maximum-memory - Assign the maximum amount of memory for the server.
* mscs-server-location - Assign the location of the server .jar file.
* mscs-server-command - Assign the command to run for the server.

The following variables may be used in some of the values of the above keys:
* $JAVA - The Java virtual machine.
* $CURRENT_VERSION - The current Mojang Minecraft release version.
* $CLIENT_VERSION - The version of the client software.
* $SERVER_VERSION - The version of the server software.
* $SERVER_JAR - The .jar file to run for the server.
* $SERVER_ARGS - The arguments to the server.
* $INITIAL_MEMORY - The initial amount of memory for the server.
* $MAXIMUM_MEMORY - The maximum amount of memory for the server.
* $SERVER_LOCATION - The location of the server .jar file.

#### Default world properties
Below are the default properties for the world. You can add one, none, or all
of the properties below to the `mscs.properties` file and adjust it to your
liking.

    mscs-enabled=true
    mscs-version-type=release
    mscs-client-version=$CURRENT_VERSION
    mscs-client-jar=$CLIENT_VERSION.jar
    mscs-client-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/$CLIENT_VERSION/$CLIENT_VERSION.jar
    mscs-client-location=/opt/mscs/.minecraft/versions/$CLIENT_VERSION
    mscs-server-version=$CURRENT_VERSION
    mscs-server-jar=minecraft_server.$SERVER_VERSION.jar
    mscs-server-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/$SERVER_VERSION/minecraft_server.$SERVER_VERSION.jar
    mscs-server-args=nogui
    mscs-initial-memory=128M
    mscs-maximum-memory=2048M
    mscs-server-location=/opt/mscs/server
    mscs-server-command=$JAVA -Xms$INITIAL_MEMORY -Xmx$MAXIMUM_MEMORY -jar $SERVER_LOCATION/$SERVER_JAR $SERVER_ARGS

#### Enabling Forge, BungeeCord, and other server software (optional)
Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/wiki/Server-Customization-Examples)
for additional information.

### Adjusting global server settings (optional)
In tandem with the `mscs.properties` file--which handles options for
individual worlds--is the `mscs` file, which handles global server settings.
This file, like the `mscs.properties` file, has default settings already
built-in to MSCS. However, you can also customize it to your liking:

**To customize the properties, you must create this file.** To create this
file:

    touch /etc/default/mscs

Once you've created the file, you need to populate it with a list of
properties.  The list of properties can be found [here](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/wiki/Global-Server-Settings).

### Configuring MSCS for multiple users (optional)
MSCS has the capability to store server data for individual users, ideal for
those who have multiple users on a computer and want each user's data to be
separated. Please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/wiki/Configuring-MSCS-for-multiple-users)
for instructions.

## Scheduling backups and other tasks
All MSCS tasks can be automated using [**cron**]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), a scheduler software that can run
programs on a set interval of time. Whether it be backups, restarts, mapping,
or any other `mscs` command, it can be scheduled using `cron`.

### Scheduling backups
Below is an example of one way how you could setup backups via `cron` to
backup a world every 2 hours:

Type the following (in any directory):

    export EDITOR=vim
    crontab -e

Page down until you get to an empty line. Then paste the following:

    0 */2 * * *  /usr/local/bin/mscs backup myWorld

* `0 */2 * * *` is the time interval to backup.
This particular expression means backup every 2 hours.
You can change this to 3, 4, 5 or whatever amount of hours to backup
X amount of hours.
You can also backup according to days, minutes, seconds, the time of
the day, and more.
See [the wiki page]
(https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/wiki/Backup-and-Restore)
for more information.
  * `myWorld` is the name of the world you wish to backup.
  Omitting this will backup all worlds.

  Finally, press escape, then type
  `:wq`
  to save and quit.

The backups will be saved in `/opt/mscs/backups`.

If you're running multiple cron jobs (i.e. mapping the world, creating backups, etc) that may overlap eachother, it's a good idea to get a package called `flock` that will prevent the jobs from overlapping so errors aren't thrown.

To install:

    sudo apt-get install flock
    
Following the example above, make your entry look like so:

     0 */2 * * *  flock -n /tmp/fcj.lockfile /usr/local/bin/mscs backup myWorld
    
This will create a lockfile in `/tmp/fcj.lockfile` (it doesn't matter where the location is, you can keep this path or change it to your liking). Simply remember to append `flock -n <filename>` to every cron job you create.

### Removing backups after X days
You can specify how long to keep backups by changing the `BACKUP_DURATION`
in the `mscs.conf` or `mscs` file (see
[adjusting global server settings](#adjusting-global-server-settings-optional)
).

### Scheduling restarts
You can schedule restarts for the server following the same method as outlined
in [scheduling backups](#scheduling-backups). Simply change the scheduled
command to:

    mscs restart <world>

Where `<world>` is the name of the world you wish to restart (omit for all
worlds).

### Scheduling mapping
You can also schedule mapping using the same method outlined in
[scheduling backups](#scheduling-backups). Simply replace the command with:

    mscs map <world>

Where `<world>` is the name of the world you wish to map (omit for all
worlds).

## Mapping the world
Minecraft Server Control Script uses [Overviewer]
(http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/) to generate maps. After [installing]
(#mapping-software-optional), modify the settings (if necessary) found in the
`mscs.conf` or `mscs` file (see [adjusting global server settings]
(#adjusting-global-server-settings-optional)):

    OVERVIEWER_BIN=$(which overviewer.py)
    OVERVIEWER_URL="http://overviewer.org"
    MAPS_URL="my.minecraftserver.com"
    MAPS_LOCATION="$LOCATION/maps"


After you've tinkered the settings to your liking, run:

    mscs map <world>

Where `<world>` is the name of the world you would like to get mapped.
Omit the world name to map all worlds.
By default maps are saved into `/opt/mscs/maps`.

### Adjusting map/mapping settings

You can individually adjust the properties that Overviewer will use for each
world by editing the world's `overviewer-settings.py` file. Properties here
include the output path of the map (i.e. you can change this to your web
server directory), and render settings. Please visit
[their website](http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/config/) for information
on config.

In order for the map to update new changes in the world,
you need to run Overviewer periodically.
Please see [scheduling mapping](#scheduling-mapping).

## Command Reference
